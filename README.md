# 2d_relativity
Simple program used to calculate the effects of 2d relativistic velocity

initialize a structure with any of the following parameters

t: time a moving object experiences
tp: time an inertial observer experiences
gama: lorentz factor
beta: speed as a fraction of the speed of light
v: velocity in m/s
